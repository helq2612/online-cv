                        Species Distribution Modeling is to learn a speciesâ€™ geographic distribution from observations of the species and environment variables. For imperfect data, such as the citizen science data from eBird, which is collected by volunteers, mistakes will cause label noise.     
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this project we treat this problem as a classification problem with class-conditional label noise. Our contribution is to introduce features of the processes that cause label noise, separately from the class features. These noise features, such as the time of observation or expertise of the observer, improve model performance and identifiability
